## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Lucas Eufrasio, a Site Reliability Engineer at Grupo JCPM who loves building and optimizing things that matter. I thrive on crafting reliable, high-performance solutions that keep costs in check and security front and center. Every day is an opportunity to streamline processes, tackle real-world challenges, and push my own limits.

## What Iâ€™m All About

**Reliability & Scale**: Designing systems that stay rock-solid as they grow.

**Performance First**: Hunting down bottlenecks and squeezing out every last drop of speed.

**Cost Efficiency**: Finding smarter ways to do more with less.

**Security by Design**: Building with defense in mind from the very start.

**Continuous Learning**: Always experimenting, always improving.
