## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas, a passionate software developer dedicated to learning and creating innovative solutions. I thrive on leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to expand my skill set.

ðŸŒ± Current Role: Software Developer at Grupo JCPM

ðŸ’» Technologies I Enjoy:

- Flutter: Crafting beautiful cross-platform apps, fueling my interest in mobile development.
- React Native: Used in some projects when React is already being used on the web and to make it easier to hire full-stack developers.
- Golang: My preferred choice for robust backend applications, although I primarily use NodeJS at work.
- Rust: Utilizing Rust in production for an image resizer and optimizer service, used in a Flutter application to reduce network bandwidth usage.
- NodeJS with TypeScript: A staple in my job stack for backend solutions.
